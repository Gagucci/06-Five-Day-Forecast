# 06-Five-Day-Forecast

## Description

The goal of this assignment was to create a weather dashboard webpage that would allow the user to search for a city and display the current weather and a five day forecast. The user would also be able to see a list of their previous searches and click on them to see the weather for that city again. The weather data was retrieved from the OpenWeather API.
